### Comments

- My initial prototype includes horizontal scrolling carroussels, so I am still unable to replicated it with just basic HTML and CSS. As a result, I have changed the look and feel of some sections of the mobile size.

MJ's feedback:

☐ Pictures: max 200kb
☐ Fix horizontal scrollbar on the big screen: .award-winning-films h2 {left: 35px}
☐ Fix horizontal scrollbar on the small screen:
☐ Each page needs one unique h1
☐ Get rid of the <b> tags and make them either <span> or <strong> or <em>.
☐ Missing alt on logo
☐ The awesome play circle has a space in the file name
☐ CSS: new-releases-section-grid: margin auto is repeated, and display grid as well
